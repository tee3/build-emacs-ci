# Build Emacs for macOS via CI

This repository is intended to build a nightly version of the Emacs
master branch and publish it to GitHub Releases.  Eventually, it could
replace the functionality and storage required for emacsformacosx.com.

This might be best done by adding the Travis CI build configuration to
the actual repository containing the build scripts fr
emacsformacosx.com at https://github.com/caldwell/build-emacs.
